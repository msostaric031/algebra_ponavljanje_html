        Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an
        early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they
        were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic
        experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They
        became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as
        the greatest progressive rock band of all time.
